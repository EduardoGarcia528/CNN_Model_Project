# CNN_Model_Project
This is a Convolutional Neural Network model that predicts the artist of several images of paintings. Because of the complexity of the task and the Class Imbalance, the model achieved a 65% accuracy 

Problem: Image Classification of Paintings by the Greatest Artists in History
Statement:
We have a dataset of a collection of paintings by 50 artists throughout history, obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time
The content of this dataset is as follows:
•	artists.csv: Information about each artist, including the number of paintings in the dataset.
•	images.zip: A collection of full-size images, divided into folders for each artist.
The plan is to design a Deep Learning model in Python capable of recognizing the artist by analyzing essential features in their paintings, such as geometric patterns or color palette.
